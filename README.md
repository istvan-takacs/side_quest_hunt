# A simple app to streamline the side quest hunting process

### How it works

1. Download the Housekeeping report as a .csv file

   
   You can do so in the Housekeeping tab and clicking "Export"
   

2. Upload it on the Side Quest Hunt app

   
   It will generate a .pdf detailing all the Maintenance slots that are:
   * Not Planned
   * Not "Stay-through"
   * Not OOO

   Side quest materials are currently elements that have the one or more of the following words in their maintencance description:
    "safe", "tv", "HDMI", "Chromecast", "arc", "charger", "ipad", "cable", "Airplay", "battery", "hairdrier"

3. Happy hunting!
